Earphone Events
==============

This is a small module which can be used to detect earphone button presses. I was aroused by curiousity on how [these buttons](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/410/506/487/487506410_866.jpg) worked. I hacked around and found, they emit a certain noise like [this](http://i.imgur.com/CqIwRiv.png). So there went my afternoon to detect the clipping part and make the button presses meaningful.

How can this be used?
====================

I originally made it to control VLC player from button presses but the module is of feeble use, as of now. For using this, you must have a way detect the noise, which means you must have a machine with a combo jack. Secondly, I have only tried my pair of samsung earphones and I am not sure how the other pairs work.
